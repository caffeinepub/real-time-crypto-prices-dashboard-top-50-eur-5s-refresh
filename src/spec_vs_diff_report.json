  "summary": "Implemented a tabbed dashboard UI with \"Overview\" and \"Prices\" tabs, and added a new compact Prices list view showing rank, icon (with fallback), name, symbol, and EUR price. Existing refresh interval selector, loading spinner, and error handling remain in the dashboard wrapper.",

    {
      "description": "Added shared formatting utilities for market cap and volume (in addition to EUR price) which are not required for the new Prices-only tab feature.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only requires a Prices tab view and EUR price formatting for that view; market cap/volume formatters are extra beyond the stated requirements.",
