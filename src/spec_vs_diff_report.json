  "summary": "REQ-8 appears implemented by swapping CoinGecko market fetch to CoinCap with 50 assets, 5s refresh, EUR conversion, and preserved CryptoAsset shape with descriptive non-2xx errors. REQ-9 is mostly implemented via a persisted theme hook and a header toggle that toggles the document root `dark` class, but the toggle lacks explicit visible English text labels (only an aria-label).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Ensure all user-facing labels for the dark mode toggle are in English (e.g., \"Dark mode\", \"Light mode\").",
      "reason": "The toggle control is icon-only and does not render visible English text such as \"Dark mode\"/\"Light mode\"; it only provides an `aria-label`.",
